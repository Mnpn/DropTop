# DropTop

DropTop lets you create music patterns by drawing lines and letting drops fall to create some sweet tunes. Inspired by Soundrop. DropTop is made in [Swift](https://apple.com/swift).

### Installation
If you don't want to compile the thing yourself, download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Mnpn03/DropTop/releases).

If you instead want to compile DropTop, you can do so by getting [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
Once that is installed, clone the repository:
Through a CLI:

`git clone git@github.com:Mnpn03/DropTop.git` to clone with SSH, or
`git clone https://github.com/Mnpn03/DropTop.git` to clone with HTTPS.

**OR**

Through Xcode:

Select "Clone from existing repository" from Xcode and enter
`git clone https://github.com/Mnpn03/DropTop.git`
to clone the repository.

After that's done, open the project in Xcode and hit "Run" after selecting the correct scheme.
